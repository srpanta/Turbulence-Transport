# Turbulence-Transport

## In this repository, I will put information about turbulence transport processes in fusion plasma. 
#### 1D transport model is used to study the plasma behaviour in the magnetically confined fusion reactor called Tokamak.
Control of turbulence transport through the formation of transport barrier in tokamak plasma is one of the important parts in the fusion reaction.
